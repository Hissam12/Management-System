   - **Remove Gravesite**: Administrators can remove gravesite records when necessary.

2. **Map Display**:
   - An interactive map is integrated into the website, providing a visual representation of the gravesites. Users can easily locate and view details of specific gravesites on the map.

3. **User Authentication**:
   - **User Login**: Registered users can log in to the system to access gravesite information and make bookings.
   - **Admin Login**: Administrators have a separate login portal to manage the overall system, including user profiles and gravesite data.

4. **Profile Management**:
   - Both users and administrators can manage their profiles, updating personal information and preferences.

5. **Transaction Management**:
   - The system includes a module for handling financial transactions related to gravesite bookings and other services.
